# permafrost-thawing-EMIC

Date of the project: March 2022

This is a small final project of the course Earth System Modelling that I took during my Master's degree. 

The project used an Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity (EMIC) to assess the effect of permafrost thawing on the Earth’s energy balance. The project was based on the following research question: How will 50% permafrost thawing affect the energy balance of the earth, as it releases stored CO2 into the atmosphere and decreases land albedo?

The code is written in Shell for Linux. It processed EMIC NetCDF outputs using CDO. The code has just a few comments, and it has been a while since I last looked at it, so it may need some updates. The project was co-developed with a classmate, credits to her as well. 

The repository includes some screenshots as a preview.
